# Sorting-Algorithms
Various sorting algorithms implemented in Java along with a description of how they work and their respective runtimes

## Overview

| Sorting Algorithm | Best-case Time Complexity | Worst-case Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Stable? | Inplace? |
|:-----------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------:|:-------:|:--------:|
|    Bubble Sort    |          Theta(N)         |         Theta(N^2)         |     Theta(1)     |   Yes   |    Yes   |
|   Insertion Sort  |          Theta(N)         |         Theta(N^2)         |     Theta(1)     |   Yes   |    Yes   |
|     Merge Sort    |        Theta(NlogN)       |        Theta(NlogN)        |     Theta(N)     |   Yes   |    No    |
|     Quicksort     |        Theta(NlogN)       |         Theta(N^2)         |    Theta(logN)   |    No   |    Yes   |
|   Selection Sort  |         Theta(N^2)        |         Theta(N^2)         |     Theta(1)     |   Yes   |    Yes   |
|     Shell Sort    |        Theta(NlogN)       |         Theta(N^2)         |     Theta(1)     |   Yes   |    Yes   |where N is the length of the array to be sorted
